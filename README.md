Installation
============

1. Check out the files using git
2. Put the files somewhere on your server (I like /var/www/dash)
3. Make sure the PHP files are executable
4. That's it

Supported Platforms
===================

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 with Apache 2.2.22 and PHP 5.3.10. It *should* work just fine on any Debian-based distro and, with a little tweaking, any POSIX-compatible OS.

There is currently no (and there is not likely to be) support for Windows / IIS systems.
